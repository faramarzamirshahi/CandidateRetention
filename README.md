# Job-Change-of-Data-Scientists
# Overview
A data science company <b>`SaGe`</b> wants to hire new data scientists.<br> All the candidates must successfully pass the company’s in-house courses before being hired.<br> 
Many candidates however, leave the company right after the training.<br>This negatively affects <b>`SaGe`</b> in terms of money, time and planning. 

<b>`SaGe`</b> HR manager Adanma wants to know which candidates stay with the company after training. 

This analysis helps to:<br>

* Better select the candidates to enroll in the courses 
* Reduce the cost and time and quality of training
* Plan the courses and categorization of candidates


# Dataset
The [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/hr-analytics-job-change-of-data-scientists) is taken from Kaggle<br>

The dataset is divided into train and test with same features with the exclusion of the target in the test data.

* The dataset is imbalanced.<br>
* Most features are categorical (Nominal, Ordinal, Binary), some with high cardinality.<br>
* Missing imputation that must be addressed in the pipeline.

## Features

|Feature|Description|
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|enrollee_id|Unique ID for candidate|
|city|City code|
|city_ development _index|Developement index of the city (scaled)|
|gender|Gender of candidate|
|relevent_experience|Relevant experience of candidate|
|enrolled_university|Type of University course enrolled if any|
|education_level|Education level of candidate|
|major_discipline|Education major discipline of candidate|
|experience|Candidate total experience in years|
|company_size|No of employees in current employer's company|
|company_type|Type of current employer|
|lastnewjob|Difference in years between previous job and current job|
|training_hours|training hours completed|
|target|0 – Not looking for job change, 1 – Looking for a job change|

## DATA EXPLORATION

### Machine Learning Model:

**Classification vs Regression:**

Classification is used to predict discrete outcomes. The outcome will be 0 or 1 , yes or no.
However regression is used to predict continuous varaibles.
In both classification and regression problems, a dataset is divided into features and target. 
Features are the variables used to make a prediction. Target is the predicted outcome.


**Logistic Regression:**

Predicts binary outcomes, meaning that there are only two possible outcomes.
logistic regression might be to decide, based on personal information, whether an employee remain
in company or not. Multiple variables, such as an applicant's gender and education,
are assessed to arrive at one of two answers: to remain or to leave the company.
So we are going to use logistic regression model as our first priority.

# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
Postgres is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Tableau to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We will be using the Logistic regression model. This decision was based on the type of data that we are working.

## Dashboard
We will be using HTML, CSS and Java Script to display our findings on a webpage. Plot libraries will be used for displaying graphs.

# Project Management
## Team roles - 1st segment
* `Square`: YI XIN ZHANG. (Set up Github ripository)<br>
* `Triangle`: Pegah. (Mock Machine learning)<br>
* `Circle`: goes to Faramarz (Mock-up database)<br>
* `X-Role`: Adanma Eleweke (Which tools to choose for the project)<br>

## Team roles - 2nd segment
* `Square`: YI XIN ZHANG. (Set up Github ripository)<br>
* `Triangle`: Pegah. (Mock Machine learning)<br>
* `Circle`: goes to Faramarz (Mock-up database)<br>
* `X-Role`: Adanma Eleweke (Which tools to choose for the project)<br>

## Communications
- We use the Breakout rooms zoom meetings for team meetings<br>
- For the daily communications we have created a slack channel.<br> 
- We also have exchanged emails for sharing repository.<br>

# Summary
The goal of the project is to find out which feature mostly affects the candidate decision of staying or leaving the company.
